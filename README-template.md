**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

With this project, I refreshed my knowledge of semantic HTML and several CSS properties. I was able to use Flexbox again and review how it works, as well as apply property inheritance from parent components.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
````
<body class="pages">
    <main class="main">
      <section class="card">
        <div class="card_container">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg"
            alt="ilustracion del articulo"
            class="card_image"
          />
```
```css
.footer_attribution,a{
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 14px;
}  
```
